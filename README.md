# Stepping Stone Dungeon

This is a text-based dungeon crawler built with C++.

## Requirements

I am using C++14 and WSL Ubuntu 20.04. But it will most likely work with other versions of C++ and Linux.

## Running the Game

- `git clone https://github.com/ferg1e/stepping-stone-dungeon.git ssd-game`
- `cd ssd-game`
- `make`
- `./game`
